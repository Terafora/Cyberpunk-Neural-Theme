## Inspiration

This theme draws inspiration from:
- **Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex** - The cyberpunk aesthetic and digital consciousness themes
- **Neural network visualizations** - Data streams and node connections
- **Holographic interfaces** - Glowing elements and electric blues
- **Digital consciousness** - The concept of diving through layers of information

The color palette specifically mirrors the aesthetic found in modern cyberpunk 3D web experiences, with electric blues, neon greens, and deep space backgrounds creating an immersive coding environment.
